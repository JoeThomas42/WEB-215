- Save search term to persistent storage, keep saved term in search field, and keep checkbox checked

- Load saved search term on page load, including header, search box/checkbox, and movies

-Enable checkbox so that search can be saved or not. If unchecked, clear term from persistent storage. If checked, save term to persistent storage.

- Intersection Observer to load all movies (10 at a time) so that all movies are rendered (not cleared as more movies render), observes the last movie on the page and stops observing once all movies have rendered

- Code is appropriately modular and spread across multiple functions. No tasks are performed outside of functions. (Only global variable declarations and event listener binding may occur outside of functions.)
